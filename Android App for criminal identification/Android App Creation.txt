Creating your Android App

Creating your Android App is simple and straightforward with Android Studio. First, open Android Studio and click File->New Project to create a new project. Then, select 'Empty Activity' in the preview and choose a preferred view. Finally, click Next to complete the creation of your Android App.

Create the Flask Server

Creating a Flask server is pretty simple. All you need is a Python script and some basic libraries. I'll assume you have Flask installed; if not, you can get it from pip.

First, create a file called app.py in your project's root directory. Then, open the file in your favorite text editor and add the following code:

from flask import Flask, jsonify, request app = Flask(__name__) @app.route('/', methods=['GET']) def index(): return 'Welcome to my server!' if __name__ == '__main__': app.run()

In the code above, we first import the Flask class from the flask library. We then create an instance of this class and assign it to the variable app . The @app.route decorator is used to bind a function to a URL path . In our case, the index() function will be invoked when someone visits the '/' path on our server . Finally, if this script is run directly (by executing python app.py ), we will start up our server .

That's all there is to creating a basic Flask server! Of course, there's much more you can

Connect Android App and server

Once you have both your Android app and Flask server up and running, it's time to connect them! In your Android code, add a new class that will manage the connection between your app and the server. We'll call this class ServerConnection.

In the ServerConnection class, add a static method called connect() which takes in a URL (the address of your Flask server) and an Activity (the activity that called connect()). Add the following code to the connect() method:

try {
URL url = new URL(serverUrl);
HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
conn.setRequestMethod("POST");
// Send data to server

OutputStreamWriter wr= new OutputStreamWriter(conn.getOutputStream());

// Get response from server

BufferedReader rd = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(conn.getInputStream()));

String line;

while ((line = rd.readLine()) != null) {

Log.d("Server Connection", line);

}
wr.close();
rd.close();
} catch (Exception e) {

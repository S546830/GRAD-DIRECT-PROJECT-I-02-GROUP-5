Overview
In older days to identify a man, there needs to check his/her id proof and match his/her face with the attached picture on that id card of that person.
There were some problems in this process sometimes the person may not keep the face with him then we cannot identify the man.
Another problem is that if the face is too old then the picture on the face detection may not be clear so we cannot identify it.
There is a possibility of the changing of the face with the increasing of age.
If the face recognition database is made a long time ago then the present time face wont not match with the id card photo.
Then we cannot identify the man who he is.
Nowadays we can easily identify a man by using a face detection app by using an android device.

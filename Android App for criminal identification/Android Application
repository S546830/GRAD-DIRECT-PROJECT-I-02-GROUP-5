If you are developing an Android application that needs to detect faces and recognize them, there are a few steps that you need to take. 
The first step is to install the GoogleFaces API v4n1 library. 
This library provides access to the face recognition capabilities of Google’s Photos service. Once you have the library installed, you can start calling the face recognition methods from your code. 
Next, you need to create a FaceDetector object and set properties like minimum angle of view (MOA) and size of detection area. 
To detect faces in video, you will also need to provide a video source and set the clip trace mode to “on”. 
Finally, you need to call the detect() method on your FaceDetector object and supply a number of arguments: a reference to the video asset,a rect object containing the position of the face within the frame, and an integer indicating which face within the frame is being searched for.

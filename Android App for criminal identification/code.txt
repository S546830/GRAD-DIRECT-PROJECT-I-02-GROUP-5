Creating your Android App

1. Creating your Android App

Open your Android Studio and click File->New Project to create a new project. Select ‘Empty Activity’ in this preview. (You can choose a preferred view!)

Select the activity template and click Next. Give your project a name and then click finish as in the below image.

Now the Android app is being created. Wait some time till your IDE does this for you! I’m creating a simple UI with a text box, buttons, and a text view as previously mentioned. For now, just copy and paste the below code in your activity_main.xml file. In the end, you’ll get a clear insight!

Now click on the run button in the IDE and you will see the particular user interface in your simulator or emulator:

Create the Flask Server

import flask
from flask import request, jsonify
import json

app = flask.Flask(__name__)
app.config["DEBUG"] = True

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def home():
return '''

Connect Android App and Server

Assuming that the reader has some basic knowledge about Android App and Python Server, I’m going to demonstrate how to connect your Android frontend application to a Python Server implemented using Flask! Here are the steps!

Creating your Android application:

Open your Android Studio and click File->New Project to create a new project. Select ‘Empty Activity’ in this preview. (You can choose a preferred view!) Select the activity template and click Next. Give your project a name and then click finish as in the below image. Now the Android app is being created. Wait some time till your IDE does this for you!

I’m creating a simple UI with a text box, buttons, and a text view as previously mentioned. For now, just copy and paste the below code in your activity_main.xml file. In the end, you’ll get a clear insight!

Now click on the run button in the IDE and you will see the particular user interface in your simulator or emulator:

Create the Flask server:
In somewhere else (not in the android project directory) create a new file named server.py and copy the following code there. Now open the cmd

Conclusion

In this article, we demonstrated how to connect an Android frontend application to a Python server implemented using Flask. We started by creating our Android app, then created the Flask server, and finally connected our Android App and server. If you followed along with the article, you should now have a working Android App that communicates with your Python server.

When we click on the link, the navigation is going to be in such a way that when we click on Authority, in the web address, /authority will be indicating the redirection
of page. This is a url pattern or mapping. With the help of /authority, we can check the code in app.py file.
@app.route("/authority") has a function named authority in which we return the authority.html file.This file can be found in templates which has code to display that page. 
All functions which help to redirect to other html pages will be in app.py file.
In authority.html file, we have given reference for registration page 'authority_reg' which is invoked in @app.route("/authority_reg"). This calls "authority_reg.html".
While filling the form, the form action is on "authority_reg2" and method is "POST". This is invoked in @app.route("/authority_reg2") in app.py file. This is used to
retrieve values from form and store in database. 
Now if it is a post method,every value written in the form will be retrieved based on the key.
POST 	method is used to hide the details that we type in form to not display in web address. 
CURSOR object is used to execute the query. 
cursor.execute is used insert values to table.
To save we use commit(). 
Javascript is used to dispaly messages in HTML pages We used this to display when user registration is successful, it shows in green color and for invalid it shown in red.
